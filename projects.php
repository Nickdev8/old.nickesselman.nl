                        Ready for a summer hackathon adventure in sunny San Francisco? In May 2025, Hackclub launched an exclusive housing program for programmers. running from June through August, and it’s not your average meet-up.

                    <p>
                        Here’s the deal: you pick a passion project, sink at least 100 hours of code into it, and we’ve got you covered—flight, housing, meals, you name it! Imagine debugging with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge and jamming on your project poolside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For my contribution, I built this very website! <a href="https://NickEsselman.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NickEsselman.nl</a>, to showcase all the wild ideas and late-night coding sessions.
                        Oh, and to keep us honest, every week in San Francisco you must clock a minimum of 40 coding hours, tracked effortlessly through <a href="https://hackatime.hackclub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hackatime</a> (Hack Club’s fork of WakaTime).

                    <p>
                        Just dream up a brand-new project and commit at least <strong>100 hours</strong> of coding before the deadline, and we’ll cover everything—flights, housing, meals, the whole shebang.

                        Miss the weekly quota, and it’s back home you go. so code hard and make every keystroke count!

                    The first time I sat down at my desk with a nice warm cup of thee,
                    Unity’s interface glowing on my screen, I knew MonkeySwing would be more than
                    “just another 2D rage game.” I typed my first line of C# and felt my heart race:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">
                    public class MonkeyController : MonoBehaviour {<br>
                        // …here be bananas (and probably a few bugs)…<br>
                    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    Each swing of the monkey’s arm became a tiny victory; each unexpected face-plant,
                    a lesson learned. When my simple prototype—swinging vines
                    and one very impatient monkey—finally came together,
                    Wrote a cheeky description, and hit “Publish” on <a href="https://nikkcc.itch.io/ms">itch.io</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although it began as a simple prototype, MonkeySwing opened
                    the door to countless new ideas, and it’s still the project I
                    point to when people ask where my game-making journey started.

                    Every print pushed my skills further and turned this Ender 3 V2 into a versatile fabrication station.
                    I still have a long mod list and small projects I want to make.

                    where we had to count our hours making projects, set sail to those projects (publish) <br>
                    We would recieve doubloons (points), calculated from the amount of votes from other hackclubbers. <br>
                    And with these doubloons you could redeem prices. For example, you could claim:<br>
                    raspberry pi 5, 3d printer, solder kit, Blahåj, System76 Keeb, and so many more! <br>

                    Ever thought chess needed more chaos? During Hack Club’s Shipwrecked challenge, I set out to reinvent the classic game in just 30 hours—and make one of my three projects go viral with 2,000+ views!

                    Inspired by a wild suggestion from my brother, I built <strong>Weird Chess</strong>: a browser-based 3D board where every piece obeys its own hilarious rule set. It’s chess… but not as you know it.

                    The secret sauce is a JSON-driven engine. Want a <em>teleporting pawn</em>? Done. An <em>exploding rook</em>? Easy. Just tweak the JSON file and watch your custom rules explode into action.
